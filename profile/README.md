# De-Learn

De-learn is a project with the goal of bringing practical Decentralized Federated Machine Learning to reality.
Think Bittorrent but for AI models.

We are committed to 2 main goals.
  1. Data is always private to you and never moved or known by any other party.
  2. Anyone can have/use/train all models for free.
